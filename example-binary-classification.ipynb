The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it!

Being Japanese myself i though that I would enjoy it, as I have watched many anime's before this, unfortunately I don't think I will ever watch an anime again after this because it is absolutely rubbish and made me feel sick. This has to be the worst show that has ever been aired on TV. The voice acting is absolutely awful, the animator needs drawing lessons and the writer....... well he needs to learn what a good story is. Many would say that the rating I have given this TV show is a bit to harsh, but believe me this is the most overrated TV show the universe has ever come across, In my opinion this doesn't even deserve 1 star. Seriously, if you've been considering to watch this TV show don't it's bad. P.S. Pikachu and Cubone need to have more screen time, their probably the only good\"\n",
